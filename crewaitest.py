## Role Playing, Focus and Cooperation

        "support representative in your team",

		"You work at crewAI (https://positive.rs) and "
        " are now working on providing "
		"support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        " for your company."
		"You need to make sure that you provide the best support!"
		"Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        " and make no assumptions."
	),
	allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)

#- By not setting `allow_delegation=False`, `allow_delegation` takes its default value of being `True`.
#- This means the agent _can_ delegate its work to another agent which is better suited to do a particular task.

### Possible Custom Tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
docs_scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(
    website_url="https://positive.rs/usluge/poslovni-konsalting/upravljanje-promenama/"
)

##### Different Ways to Give Agents Tools
#- Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
#- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.
#**Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

### Creating Tasks

		"Make sure to use everything you know "
        "to provide the best support possible."
		"You must strive to provide a complete "
        "and accurate response to the customer's inquiry."
    ),
    expected_output=(
	    "A detailed, informative response to the "
        "customer's inquiry that addresses "
        "all aspects of their question.\n"
        "The response should include references "
        "to everything you used to find the answer, "
        "including external data or solutions. "
        "Ensure the answer is complete, "
		"leaving no questions unanswered, and maintain a helpful and friendly "
		"tone throughout."

        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
		"thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        " find the information, "
		"ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
		"relevant feedback and improvements.\n"

### Creating the Crew
#### Memory
#- Setting `memory=True` when putting the crew together enables Memory.
